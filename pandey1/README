Author:  Sushil Pandey
Program:  prog1
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog1'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog1' at the command prompt after building the program.

   
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
    This programs takes the two integer, double value and sets the fractiona 
    and reduces as per necessary conditions.

    
PROGRAM INPUT
    A sigle fractional input is given by user on keyboard and other inputs are given in main.cpp
    
PROGRAM OUTPUT
    All output is shown in terminal which are in fractional and decimal
    
PROGRAM DESIGN

    The general algorithm 
    reads the user given input and sets into fraction
    outputs the inputs given in main.cpp
