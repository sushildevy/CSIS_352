Program:  prog6
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog6'
   
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog6 inflie' at the command prompt after building the program.
   Here infile is the file name

   
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
    This programs creates C++ program that calculates and reports payroll for a company.
    
    
PROGRAM INPUT
    Inputs are given through the  file name infile.
    
PROGRAM OUTPUT
    All output written in output files :payroll and employees;
    To see the output, simply Type 'cat payroll' or 'cat employees'

PRogram DESIGN
    This program construct  C++ program that calculates and reports payroll for a company.
    There are five classes in separate files with separate implementation. Classes  
    include the 'date.h' from previous program. Employee class inherits Person class
    Class HourlyEmployee ans SalaryEmployee inherits Employee class. class Employees 
    has stl list as a composition.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested as per data available in prog6data making it infile. Other
   simple self testing are done. 
   
   
I have given my best in this Assignment and I have thrown the exception in required spot.
