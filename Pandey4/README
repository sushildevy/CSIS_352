Program:  prog4
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog4'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog4' at the command prompt after building the program.

   
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
    This programs constructs the Abstract data type of linkedlist and performs the various function  
    
    
PROGRAM INPUT
    Inputs are given through the main file.
    
PROGRAM OUTPUT
    All output is shown in terminal , list values are shown 
    
PROGRAM DESIGN
    This program constrcut a default constructor with first node =0 and count =0
    Also a constructor with output format of ascending and descending is constructed. As a default, a ASCENDING, member of enum is set. Formating can be changed as per user desire in main file. 
    Function Ascending() and Descending() sets the node value in ascending and descending order
    Merge function combines the lists
    deleteItem deletes the first one item equal to passed value
    deleteAll function deletes all mathcig value
    insertItem inserts the items in the linked list
    removeDuplicates removes the duplicates items from the list

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested as per the main file provided, Personally I created some lists of char and float to check templated types and some assignments
   
   
   
I have given my best in this Assignment and every function and methods works as per the sample output results and I have thrown the exception in required spots.
