Program:  prog5
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog5'
   
RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog5' at the command prompt after building the program.

   
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
    This programs constructs the templated graph ADT with the use of stl vector containeer. 
    
    
PROGRAM INPUT
    Inputs are given through the main file.
    
PROGRAM OUTPUT
    All output is shown in terminal , Graph values are shown 
    
PROGRAM DESIGN
            This program construct the default constructor with Weight as UNWEIGHTED AND 
            Direction as UNDIRECTED and construct other constructor as with weight and direction as WEIGHTED 
            and DIRECTED. Also construct with WEIGHTED only and DIRECTED only. vertexCount and vertexEdge counts 
            number of vertices and edges respectively in the Graph.Function insertVertex inserts the vertex to There
            Graph and insertEdge inserts the edge in Graph and use 1 as default value if Weighted is not proided
            edgeWeight gives the weight of edge if exists. Function isAdjacentTo checks the adjacency and returns 
            true if exists and false otherwise. Function destroy destrys the graph object and initialize vertexCount 
            and edgeCount to 0. Also in insertEdge, starting index and ending index can not be same!!

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested as per the main file provided, Personally I created some graph object of ints and float to check templated types and other functions
   
   
   
I have given my best in this Assignment and every function and methods works as per the sample output results and I have thrown the exception in required spots.
