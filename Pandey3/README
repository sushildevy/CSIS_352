Program:  prog3
   This program was written in C++ and distributed to be built on a 
   Linux system.  To build the program, type 'make' to create the 
   executable called 'prog3'

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
   Type 'prog3' at the command prompt after building the program.

   
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
    This programs constructs the Abstract data type of Array and performs the vvarious function  
    
    
PROGRAM INPUT
    Inputs are given through the main file.
    
PROGRAM OUTPUT
    All output is shown in terminal which are in Array format
    
PROGRAM DESIGN
    The general algorithm is :
    The program constructs array with size 0, with size provided by user and also with starting index and end index. Function resize changes the array size.
    Function Size gives array length, function getStartIndex gives the starting index, function setStartIndex sets the starting index, function Reverse returns the array contents in reverse order. Ascending and descending function returns array contents in ascendinga and descending order without 
    canging the original array.
    
    
    
   
PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of testscores.

PROGRAM TESTING
   This program was tested with different sets of testscores from main 
   
   
   
I have given my best in this Assignment and every function and methods works as per the sample output results and I have thrown the exception in required spots.
